## Introduction

Black holes are compact objects around which gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They form when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, leading to the collapse of their cores into a singularity. After a star explodes, if the mass that remains exceeds ~3 solar masses (the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit) a black hole can be formed. Smaller stars evolve into white dwarfs or neutron stars instead. After its formation, a black hole can grow by absorbing material from its surroundings. The scientific consensus is that most galaxies have a supermassive black hole of millions of solar masses in their center.

This project focuses on the scientific evidence that shows black holes exist, both the theory and the detection. Although black holes cannot be observed directly since no light escapes from them, their existence can be inferred through various powerful effects they have on their surroundings. These effects include X-ray emissions, gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, and more.
