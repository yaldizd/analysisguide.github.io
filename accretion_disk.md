# The Discovery of Cygnus X-1 via its Accretion Disk
## Initial Observations
In 1964, a rocket carrying X-ray Geiger counters was launched. These Geiger counters conducted a survey of a 8.4° patch of the night sky near the galactic core, in the 1-15 Å range. The 1965 paper analyzing the survey by Bowyer et. al. [2] was the first observational evidence for the existance of black holes. The object Cygnus X-1, located at $$\alpha_{2000} = 19^h 58^m 22^s$$, $$\delta_{2000} = +35° 12' 06''$$, emitted X-rays best explained by a black hole accretion disk being present there.

The paper wasn't too confident in their potential black hole identifications and had many other objects mentioned alongside Cyg X-1, but this particular system kept being observed in the decades to come, and is now considered the first discovered black hole. In his 1988 book 'A Brief History of Time' [3], Stephen Hawking wrote:

>I have a bet with Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology that in fact Cygnus X-1 does not contain a black hole! This is a form of insurance policy for me. I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. But in that case, I would have the consolation of winning my bet, which would bring me four years of the magazine Private Eye. If black holes do exist, Kip will get one year of Penthouse. When we made the bet, in 1975, we were 80 percent certain that Cygnus was a black hole. By now, I would say that we are about 95 percent certain, but the bet has yet to be settled.

## Determining the Mass
Perhaps the most important evidence that boosted the certainty Hawking mentions came in 1972. The binary system Cygnus X-1 has a black hole and a blue supergiant orbiting it. Charles Thomas Bolton used spectral redshift measurements of the BSG and the accretion disk over time to confirm that Cyg X-1 is a binary system, and plotted a velocity-phase graph [4].

Using the velocity variation in the graph, it is possible to estimate the masses of the objects. The mass function value,

$$
f(M) = \frac{M_2^3 \ \sin^3i}{(M_1+M_2)^2} = 0.16
$$

Requires that the compact object mass, $$M_1 > 12 M_{\odot}$$. Since this mass is far too high to belong to a neutron star, astrophysicists correctly argued that the system Cyg X-1 must contain a black hole.
