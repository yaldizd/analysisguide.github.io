 abstract = {Eight new sources of cosmic x-rays were detected by two Aerobee surveys in 1964. One source, from Sagittarius, is close to the galactic center, and the other, from Ophiuchus, may coincide with Kepler's 1604 supernova. All the x-ray sources are fairly close to the galactic plane.},

abstract={THE ninth magnitude BOIb star HDE 226868 is closely coincident with the position of Cygnus X-1 and its associated variable radio source1. Dolan2 has pointed out that Cyg X-1 appears to be a two component X-ray source. One component has a synchrotron spectrum, and the other has a thermal (or bremsstrahlung) spectrum. The latter component varies on a time scale of days in a way that suggests it is being eclipsed. Therefore I decided to take photographic spectra of HDE 226868 to look for velocity and spectrum variations that might be correlated with the X-ray fluctuations. I find that the velocity of the star varies with a period consistent with that of the X-ray variation. It may not be possible, however, to interpret the X-ray variations in terms of simple eclipses.},
