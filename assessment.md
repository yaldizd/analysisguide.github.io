title: Detection of Sagittarius A* Through Stellar Orbits

# My assessment of the evidence

It is not an easy thing to claim that a concept as strange and impossible-sounding as a black hole exists in the real world. Even though they were mathematically being studied as early as the 1910s, physicists took half a century to acknowledge that black holes could be real. Of course this realization was helped by the discovery of neutron stars in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell Burnell. As Wheeler (who coined the term "black hole") and Ruffini wrote in their 1971 paper "Introducing the Black Hole" [11],
>The quasi-stellar object, the pulsar, the neutron star have all come onto the scene of physics within the space of a few years. Is the next entrant destined to be the black hole? If so, it is difficult to think of any development that could be of greater significance.

Even though the X-ray source Cygnus X-1 was discovered in 1964, it took until the 70s that the research on it could finally agree that it is a black hole. This, I think, is why there isn't a single person cited as the one who discovered the black hole. Such a bold claim could only be made by the collaboration and agreement of some of the best astrophysicists at the time.

Similarly, LIGO is the collaboration of many great minds, primarily from Caltech and MIT. It took years of careful planning and incredibly precise engineering to build the observatory, and it amazes me that LIGO can detect a change that is a small fraction of the width of a single proton. These factors, combined with the massive peer reviewed paper from 2016 and the fact that black holes were completely accepted by that point tells me that we have come very far in this field, and there is no doubting the results of this research.

And finally when it comes to the Event Horizon Telescope, no one can deny that this is the most publicly impressive part of black hole research. The reach of the results from the 2019 paper was incredible. And since it is direct observation, the photo is immediately understandable and believable. The telescope array itself, with a resolution of 25 microarcseconds, has been very reliable and productive. The EHT has taken images of black hole jets as well, advancing our knowledge in the effects of black holes on their galaxies. Since it has only imaged two different black holes so far, I'm excited for more results to come from EHT.
