# Direct interferometry
Black holes surrounded by transparent emission regions produce a "shadow" due to gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To study this, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a global array of radio telescopes operating at a wavelength of 1.3 mm was built. By linking together radio telescopes across the globe, we are able to achieve a very long baseline, creating what is basically an Earth-sized interferometer [7]. In 2019, the EHT captured the first event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87 [8]. These images reveal a bright, asymmetric emission ring with a diameter of $$42 \pm 3$$ microarcseconds, surrounding a central dark region consistent with the predicted shadow of a Kerr black hole (the solution to the Field Equations for a rotating black hole). So thanks to these EHT results, we know that this black hole is rotating, with its axis pointing away from the Earth by 17 degrees. 

The asymmetry in brightness is explained by relativistic beaming caused by plasma rotating at near-light speeds. The findings aligned with simulations based on general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, leading to an estimated black hole mass of $$(6.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^9 M_\odot$$. These observations once again confirmed the presence of supermassive black holes in galactic centers, and provided insight into this new tool for studying the extreme gravity of black holes [9].

Continued EHT imaging over the next few years gave us an image of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way. These images are crucial for learning more about the strong magnetic fields that spiral around the black hole [10].
